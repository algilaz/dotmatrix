Program Overview:
The Image to Gcode Converter is a software tool developed under The GNU General Public License v3.0 by Dr. Algirdas Lazauskas from Kaunas University of Technology. This tool converts images (in formats such as PNG, JPEG, and BMP) into G-code commands that control a Dot-matrix holographic master shooting system. This system produces holograms by exposing a photoresist with diffraction gratings, where each dot represents an individual diffraction grating. The diffraction gratings control how light interacts with the hologram, creating the desired optical effects based on the input image.

Features:
Grayscale and Binarization Conversion:
o The program converts color images into grayscale for further processing.
o Users can apply a thresholding technique, converting grayscale images into binary images by setting a threshold value, where pixels are either black or white based on the intensity.
Dithering:
o The program includes Floyd-Steinberg dithering, which distributes the quantization error to neighboring pixels, allowing for smoother transitions in binary images. The dithering intensity can be adjusted for finer control over the binary conversion process.
Intensity-to-Z Mapping:
o The Intensity-to-Z Mapping feature controls the Z-axis rotation angle of the diffraction grating on each dot according to the grayscale intensity of the image's pixels. Darker pixels (lower intensity values) result in greater Z-axis rotation angles, creating steeper diffraction gratings. Brighter pixels (higher intensity values) result in smaller Z-axis rotation angles, producing shallower diffraction gratings.
o This mapping controls the orientation of each individual diffraction grating, allowing for precise control over how the hologram diffracts light, encoding the pixel intensity as a specific angle in the hologram.
G-code Generation:
o The program generates G-code commands that control:
 X and Y coordinates for positioning the diffraction grating.
 Z-axis rotation angle for adjusting the grating orientation.
 Laser activation and pause commands to ensure precise exposure of the photoresist during the hologram creation process.
Program Workflow:
Input Image:
o Users select an image file from their system. The program supports commonly used image formats like PNG, JPEG, and BMP.
Image Processing:
o The program converts the image into grayscale.
o Users can choose to:
 Binarize the image by setting a threshold, or
 Apply dithering to smooth out the transition between light and dark areas of the image.
o Intensity-to-Z Mapping feature maps the pixel intensities to Z-axis rotation angles for the diffraction gratings, allowing for nuanced control over how each dot reflects light.
G-code Generation Options:
o Dot Size and Dot Spacing: Control the physical size and spacing between adjacent dots in the hologram.
o Thresholding and Dithering: Options to convert the image into binary form for engraving.
o Intensity-to-Z Mapping: Maps grayscale intensity to Z-axis rotation values for each dot, controlling the diffraction grating angles.
o Z-Min and Z-Max: Define the range of Z-axis rotation angles corresponding to the pixel intensity values.
G-code Output:
o The program generates the final G-code based on the processed image, dot size, and spacing settings.
o The G-code is saved to a file, which can be loaded into the dot-matrix holographic system to create the hologram.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The program includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter, offering a user-friendly environment to:
• Select the input image file and define the output G-code file path.
• Set key parameters such as dot size, dot spacing, threshold values, and dithering intensity.
• Enable or disable the Intensity-to-Z Mapping feature, and set the Z-min and Z-max values.
• Preview the processed image before converting it to G-code.
• Convert the image to G-code with a single button click.
The GUI uses Matplotlib to display the processed image, allowing users to visualize the changes made by binarization, dithering, and Intensity-to-Z Mapping before generating the G-code.

Dot-Matrix Holographic System Context:
The Dot-matrix holographic system uses the G-code generated by this program to create holograms by exposing a photoresist with diffraction gratings. Each dot in the hologram represents an individual grating, and the system uses precise positioning and control to engrave these gratings based on the input image.
• Diffraction gratings control how light interacts with the hologram, and their orientation determines the optical properties of the final hologram.
• The program allows for the adjustment of diffraction grating orientation angles via Z-axis rotation, based on pixel intensity values, enabling the creation of highly detailed and dynamic holograms.

Usage Instructions:
